# Design and Fabrication of a programable electronic circuit 

The process will start with designing the electronic circuit and developing its PCB diagram by using Kicad 5.1.0 Circuit design [download kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/)  software and then send it for milling. Component soldering and programming followed by testing.

The first step is to draw a schematic design of the circuit to fabricate using a pcb design software such as KICAD.
