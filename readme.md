# INTRODUCTORY DAY-1 (DATE - 18.03.2019)

*Mentors for the FAB LAB- Mr. Fransicso and Mr. Shibu.
Introduction provided by Shri Manas Panda (Director- STPI Bhubaneswar)about newly set-up FAB LAB in Bhubaneswar at 11:00 am followed by brief of the training to be provided to the participants by Mr. Fransisco.

Further, Dr. Omkar Rai (Director General- STPI) motivated the participants from STPI Centres across pan India to give the best during the training and be a brand ambassador for FAB Labs to be executed across the country in future.

Mr. Fransicso started the training session at 12 noon. The participants were informed about the objectives of the training and the basic knowledge of FAB Labs. The safety associated with FAB Lab along with the do's and dont's were also informed to the trainees.

Further, after lunch FAB Lab established at STPI Bhubaneswar was visited. All the equipments installed were demonstrated and working of the equipments were briefed.

Methods for fabrication are either additive in nature or substractive in nature. Both kind of fabrication tools are installed in FAB Lab.

Equipments under substractive method of fabrication and their working are discussed below:-

(i) CNC (Computer Numerical Control) Machine- CNC is a machine which operates in 3 dimensions. The basic operation of CNC is to fabricated wooden material or any other soft material which can hold its shape during the process of fabrication. It contains a milling bit which as per the programming assigned provides the required shapes in all the three dimensions. The CNC installed at FAB Lab is of Shop bot make and its dimensions are 96 inches x 48 inches. CNC is attached with a dust collector which during the process of fabrication collects the dust emitted from the material under fabrication.

(ii) Band Saw- It is an equipment used for simple cutting. The blades used in Band Saw are thick in size and are used for normal cutting of materials which can hold its shape during the process of fabrication.

(iii) Scroll Saw Cutter:- It is used for providing curved shapes to the materials under fabrication. The blade used is very thin in size due to which it has the capability to provide the required shape to the materials.

(iv) Apart from this, cleaning tools were also installed in FAB Lab which is used for cleaning the devices with high water pressure.

(v) Vinyl Cutter:- This equipments is used by various signage and logo making companies. Vinyl sheet is inserted into the cutter and as per the programming it cuts the vinly sheet. The blade attached to the vinyl cutter is either operation or not in operation. There is no intermediatery mode of working.

(vi) Laser Cutter:- It is a 3-axis equipmentThe laser used in FAB Lab Bhubhaneswar is CO2 compliant, 80 watts Laser Cutter. The material which can be processed in laser cutter are relatively soft in nature like plastic sheets. The hard metals can be marked using lasers but cannot be cut. The laser cutter is attched with a 3 way filter which filters the large particles in the first stage, other minute particles in the second stage and gases in the third stage after which it can be difussed in the open air. This 3 way filter is used as the Laser cutter installed in FAB Lab id working in a closed environment.

Equipments under additive menthod of fabrication and their working are discussed below:-

(i) 3-D Printers:- The make installed at FAB Lab is Sindoh. It is a basic 3-D printer which works on the principle of Fused Fillament Deposition. It is a device which works on 3 axis and provides the required shape by the means of deposition of the material used for printing.

(ii) Stereo Lithography Printer- The raw material used in this printer is Liquid resin. Printing is done through laser as the plastic used for fabrication solidifies when light is brought in contact at the required locations through programming.

(iii) Ink Jet Printer or Poly jet Printer:- It is a 2 axis machine which fabricates in 2 dimensions.
The first day of the training concluded. 

*FAB LAB TRAINING - DAY-2 - 19/03/2019

The day started with setting up PCs for uploading the changes in the Repository on Web. The process changes done in the local PC through Visual Source Code (VSC) and its process for synchronization on web was discussed in the starting session. For performing editing and other functions several tools are available under extension tab. The basic extension installed was Code Spell Checker ver 1.6.10. Many other extensions are also available which can be installed as per requirement.
Further, the process of cloning was demonstrated in which the changes made in the VSC had to be backed-up in PC. For creating a clone, following command was used in a new window of VSC:-
CTRL + SHIFT + P
A small browser would open where a symbol (>) would appear. In that window a command git:clone has to be operated. As soon as the command is operated a box would appear where repository URL is asked. The repository URL can be obtained from the individual git hub account under the tab 'Your repository'. After selecting the required repository, a green colored drop down with name mentioned as 'CLONE or DOWNLOAD would appear'. On clicking the drop-down we can obtain the URL of our repository. Copy the URL and paste in the the VSC where URL of repository was required.
Further, the system would ask to select a folder where cloning has to be done. On selecting the folder, a small window would pop-up asking to open the repository. The cloning of the changes done in local PC is now complete and further step by step process for uploading the same to web has been mentioned below.
The step-by-step process for synchronizing the local PC and web is as under:-
(i) Any changes done or the text written in the VSC has to be saved by pressing CTRL+S.
(ii) Further the changes saved could be seen in the lest side of the screen under source control. The symbol indicates the number of changes which are to be incorporated.
(iii) Then the changes to be done has to be provided with commit on each occasion the changes are done.
(iv) Further, the changes are to be tick marked which is available at SOURCE CONTROL:GIT
(v) Then the changes done are to be pushed to the web using 3 dots available in the same section.
While performing the above task a problem was encountered wherein VSC has given a error that ' please tell me who you are'. The error occurred since the email id and name of user has to be specified while synchronizing the local PC and web. VSC has also demonstrated the command which is used to be recognized which is ' git config --global user.email "email id of user" and gir config -- global username "name of user".
Once the command is operated , git would recognize the user on web and an email for the same would be sent to the registered email id.
** Note:- The practice of adding precise commit while pushing the data has to be undertaken as it would help the user to recognize the changes made.
Git user id and password is required for making changes on web which is a one time process. After saving and pushing the data as mentioned above the same can be reviewed over web under the individual repository.
Further, uploading the images in the repository and wed was explored. During the execution error was found due to non- syncing of local PC and web. The system prompted to pull from the web prior to operating the push command. To resolve the issue, the changes made in the VSC were corrected so that sync with web can be achieved and web and local repository was synced. Once the syncing process was done, the changes made were easily uploaded on web as well as on local machine.
Once the issue was resolve, the following command was used to upload the images

Experiment-1 - 3-D Printing
Further, hands-on 3D Printers was done by a team of 10 members. The 3 D printer used was 3D WOX (Sindho). During the practical, the basic operation of the 3D printer was demonstrated. On the touch scree panel 4 options were available like cartridge, print, settings and info. Initially the process of cleaning and maintenance to 3D printer was demonstrated. The cartridge used in 3 D printer is PLA (Poly Lactic Acid). While performing the maintenance of the 3D printer the PLA has to be removed from the printer which was done by the team. The cartridge contained a wire of PLA rolled in it.
PLA Roll
 
The rolling of the wire in the cartridge has to be done in such a way that there is proper tension in the roll. During the maintenance of the roll of the cartridge, the team was informed that, if any bend was found in the PLA, that portion might not provide a proper printing. The team during the maintenance of the PLA found a bend and that small portion of the bend was removed from the roll.

Further the roller was fitted into the cartridge. It is worth noting that, while fitting the roll in the cartridge any part of the roll should not be out of the cartridge. The cartridge was the inserted in the 3D printer. Further, a section were the collection of wasted PLA which the roller uses for self cleaning was demonstrated and the process to clean it was shown. The cartridge is attached with a chip which contains all the information about the cartridge like length of the roll, color and physical properties of the filament. The diameter of the filament in the cartridge was 1.75 mm.
The device was not ready to print. The team was asked to print anything which can be of useful nature. The team decide to produce a clip which can be able to holed the loose roll of PLA in the cartridge when it is not in use. The team found the image of the clip on the website which was downloaded and further was sliced using Sindoh software. Proper orientation of the clip was selected and the item was processed to be printed on the 3D printer. The team performed the task and the first test product of FAB Lab, STPI Bhubaneswar was produced.

Experiment-2 - Vinyl Cutting
Further, Vinyl Cutter was demonstrated to the set of participants. The raw material used in the Vinyl Cutter is the Vinyl Sheet. This equipment is used by companies working in the field of signage and logo designing. The vinyl roll has to be properly placed between the rollers installed in the cutter. Further, there are some vertical line according to which the vinyl roll can be set-up in the cutter. For fixing the roll, it has to be place in the white section were the tube is having a rough surface soo that the grip is good. The user should also keep in mind that the vinyl is fixed at a position were there is minimum loss of vinyl sheet. Through this process the user can minimize the wastage of the vinyl sheet.
