## Stereo Lithography Printer-Miling Machine (Roland DGSHAPE Monofab SRM-20):-

The SRM-20 portable milling machine can mill a broad range of materials, including modeling wax, chemical wood, foam, acrylic, poly acetate, ABS and PC board. 

This machine is capable of cutting a wide variety of materials including
chemical wood, acrylic, and ABS. It is also capable of a range of accuracy
settings from prototype to product design. Plus its small size and fully
covered design allows you to enjoy cutting more safely and with peace of
mind.

On demand production of parts, tools, product prototypes, etc.
Simplified operation for users of all abilities
Powerful spindle motor
Improved spindle and collet system
Reduced noise and dust prevention from fully enclosed cover
Software suite with latest SRP Player software

Max. work area 8" (X) by 6" (Y) by 2.38" (Z)
It is a form of 3D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using photochemical processes by which light causes chemical monomers to link together to form polymers. Stereo lithography can be used to create things such as prototypes for products in developing computer hardware, as well as in many other applications.

The raw material used in this printer is Liquid resin. Printing is done through laser as the plastic used for fabrication solidifies when light is brought in contact at the required locations through programming.
