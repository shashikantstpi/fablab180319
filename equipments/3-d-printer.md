## 3-D Printer:-
3D printing is any of various processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer. The precision, repeatability and material range have increased to the point that 3D printing is considered as an industrial production technology, with the name of additive manufacturing. 3D printed objects can have a very complex shape or geometry and are always produced starting from a digital 3D model.

The make installed at FAB Lab is Sindoh (3DWAX). It is a basic 3-D printer which works on the principle of Fused Filament Deposition. It is a device which works on 3 axis and provides the required shape by the means of deposition of the material used for printing.

### 3D Printer, SINDOH (3DWAX)

This machine is used to print 3D objects as per the design.

Operating Procedure:

1. Switch on the machine with appropriate power 110v/240v.
2. Cleaning the build plate for any dust or plastic remains.
3. Inserting filament to the cartridge and loading the cartridge in to the machine.
4. The plastic filament used have dia of 1.75 mm and the extruder compress it to 0.40 mm while printing.

Printing Process

Design the part Slicing Printing the plastic used for 3D printing is Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) a bio-plastic. The printer heat the nozzle first and then the build bed/plate and then start printing.
