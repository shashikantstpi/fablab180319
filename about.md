## What is a Fab-Lab?
Fab Lab - Digital Fabrication Laboratory, is a place where anyone can make (almost)anything, using digital design, 3D printers, laser cutting and other advanced technological means.

In its essence, Fab-Lab is about turning ideas into a reality. All planning, design, production and fabrication processes are done in one place, to create one unique product. All you need to bring with you is an idea, and MadaTech’s Fab-Lab supplies the tools and the guidance to bring it to fruition.

In the “old world”, production was thought of as something that is done only by professionals. Factories were seen as busy, dangerous places for the inexperienced. Most of all, each product was duplicated by hundreds, if not thousands.

At the Wanger Family Fab Lab, production is a personal process. Modern tools enable individuals to turn their ideas into reality, even downloading products from the internet and personalizing them, whether as an original gift for a loved-one, or as a prosthetic for the disabled.

## Who is Fab-Lab for?
FabLab enables anyone at any age, to experiment in turning ideas to tangible reality.

Fab-Lab is looking for “makers” – for whom “do-it-yourself” is a motto: from curious children who take things apart only to put them back together; hobbyists who love robots, model airplanes, model building, photography and more; professionals who love to do-it-themselves; artists; innovators in spirit and in occupation and any other individuals, young and old, who would like to “make” and would like to share from their experiences.

Whether conceptual artists or “technology geeks”, school age children or university students, young or old, men or women – the Wanger Family Fab-Lab is available for anyone who has the passion to “make”.
